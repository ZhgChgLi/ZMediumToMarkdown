ZMediumToMarkdown lets you download Medium post and convert it to markdown format easily.

This project can help you to make an auto-sync or auto-backup service from Medium, like auto-sync Medium posts to Jekyll or other static markdown blog engines or auto-backup Medium posts to the Github page.

You can also use [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) as the auto service.

## Features

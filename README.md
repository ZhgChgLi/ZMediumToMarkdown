## Things to know
- If you would like to remove the ZMediumToMarkdown watermark located at the bottom of the page, you may do so. I don't mind.
- Since ZMediumToMarkdown is not an official tool and Medium does not provide a public API for it, I cannot guarantee that the parser target will not change in the future. However, I have tried to test it for as many cases as possible. If you encounter any rendering errors, please feel free to create an issue and I will fix them as soon as possible.
